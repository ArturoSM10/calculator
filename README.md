# calculator
Project from TOP, this project was a little bit hard tha the others, at the begin it seems you have the necessary knowledge to finish it quickly, but with the restrictions it must have like canÂ´t divide 0/0 or the decimal point, string several operations or if the user tried to block the calculator, etc.
At the end i did the project in a different way than i started so i think this project objective is to make you think how your program will affect your application and how easy or difficult can be to solve those little restrictions so its not the best choice to start program without consider the restictions
